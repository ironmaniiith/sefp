## Practise Assignment - 1

**Aim**: To develop a game in JavaScript

**Prerequisites**: Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

### Description

**Mode of the game**

1. Single player (opponent is computer)

2. Double player

**List of games**:

* Tic tac toe
* 2048
* Maze games (if possible, also the maze solver, go have a look at the algorithms to solve them. They are really cool)
* Minesweeper
* 4 dots
* Pair game/Memory game (flip cards to make pair)
* Pacman
* Space invaders
* Dxball
* Five in a row
* Checkers
* Javascript typing test
* 15 puzzle

However, it's not compulsory to restrict to the above idea. You are free to create your own game as well :smile:. The main focus here is to get a good hand over JavaScript, which will be very much required in your main projects.

**Some points to keep in mind**

* Upload your game's source code on github.
* Make sure not to commit big changes in a single commit on github, commits should be to the point, precise and commit messages should be self explanatory.
* This assignment is for practise, copying the code from any other source is **highly discouraged**. However, you can take other resources like, images, sound, characters etc. to make your game look nicer. Make sure to give the link from where you have taken any resources
* In the games which are single player, **DO NOT** make random computer moves. For example, in Tic-Tac-Toe, you can make a strategy for computer so that the computer may never lose.
* Write neat indented code (you can use online beautifiers/indenters). Variable naming should be done very carefully. Maintain modularity. Functional programming is always encouraged. 
* **DO NOT** hard code your game logic.
* You are free to do this practise assignment in team or in individual. However if this is done in team, then we expect some really good team effort from your side.
* Personal suggestion (good if you follow): Try to use linux as much as you can.

**PS:** Any further updates will be done on this repository only, so keep yourself updated. It's recommended to watch the repositories for any changes.

If you need any references, please let me know. Good if you make 2-3 class representative who can tell us what problems you are facing and what resources you need. The class representatives can add the problems in the issue tracker of this repository...

Happy Coding :smile:
